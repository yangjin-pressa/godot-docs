# VisualShaderNodeIf

Inherits: VisualShaderNode < Resource < RefCounted < Object

## Description

This visual shader node has six input ports:

- Port 1 and 2 provide the two floating-point numbers `a` and `b` that will be compared.
- Port 3 is the tolerance, which allows similar floating-point numbers to be considered equal.
- Ports 4, 5, and 6 are the possible outputs, returned if `a == b`, `a > b`, or `a < b` respectively.
