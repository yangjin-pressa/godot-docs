# EditorScriptPicker

**Inherits:** EditorResourcePicker < HBoxContainer < BoxContainer < Container < Control < CanvasItem < Node < Object

Godot editor's control for selecting the ``script`` property of a Node.

## Description

Similar to EditorResourcePicker, this Control node is used in the editor's Inspector dock, but only to edit the ``script`` property of a Node. Default options for creating new resources of all possible subtypes are replaced with dedicated buttons that open the "Attach Node Script" dialog. Can be used with EditorInspectorPlugin to recreate the same behavior.

**Note:** You must set the script_owner for the custom context menu items to work.

## Properties

- script_owner: Node

## Property Descriptions

script_owner: Node  
The owner Node of the script property that holds the edited resource.

Methods:
- void set_script_owner(Node value)
- Node get_script_owner()
