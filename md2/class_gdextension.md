# GDExtension

**Inherits:** Resource < RefCounted < Object>

A native library for GDExtension.

## Description

The GDExtension resource type represents a shared library which can expand the functionality of the engine. The GDExtensionManager singleton is responsible for loading, reloading, and unloading GDExtension resources.

Note: GDExtension itself is not a scripting language and has no relation to GDScript resources.

## Methods

- get_minimum_library_initialization_level
  Returns the lowest level required for this extension to be properly initialized (see the InitializationLevel enum).

- is_library_open
  Returns true if this extension's library has been opened.

## Enumerations

### InitializationLevel

- INITIALIZATION_LEVEL_CORE = 0
  The library is initialized at the same time as the core features of the engine.

- INITIALIZATION_LEVEL_SERVERS = 1
  The library is initialized at the same time as the engine's servers (such as RenderingServer or PhysicsServer3D).

- INITIALIZATION_LEVEL_SCENE = 2
  The library is initialized at the same time as the engine's scene-related classes.

- INITIALIZATION_LEVEL_EDITOR = 3
  The library is initialized at the same time as the engine's editor classes. Only happens when loading the GDExtension in the editor.
