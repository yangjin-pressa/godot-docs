# AnimatableBody2D

**Inherits:** StaticBody2D < PhysicsBody2D < CollisionObject2D < Node2D < CanvasItem < Node < Object

A 2D physics body that cannot be moved by external forces. When moved manually, it affects other bodies in its path.

## Description

An animatable 2D physics body. It can't be moved by external forces or contacts, but can be moved manually by other means such as code, AnimationMixer (with AnimationMixer.callback_mode_process set to AnimationMixer.ANIMATION_CALLBACK_MODE_PROCESS_PHYSICS), and RemoteTransform2D.

When moved, its linear and angular velocity are estimated and used to affect other physics bodies in its path. This makes it useful for moving platforms, doors, and other moving objects.

## Properties

- sync_to_physics: true (bool)

## Property Descriptions

**sync_to_physics** = true (bool)

- set_sync_to_physics(value: bool): void
- is_sync_to_physics_enabled(): bool

If true, the body's movement will be synchronized to the physics frame. This is useful when animating movement via AnimationPlayer, for example on moving platforms. Do **not** use together with PhysicsBody2D.move_and_collide().
