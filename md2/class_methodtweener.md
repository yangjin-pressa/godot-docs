# MethodTweener

**Inherits:** `Tweener` < `RefCounted` < `Object`

Interpolates an abstract value and supplies it to a method called over time.

## Description

MethodTweener is similar to a combination of `CallbackTweener` and `PropertyTweener`. It calls a method providing an interpolated value as a parameter. See `Tween.tween_method()` for more usage information.

The tweener will finish automatically if the callback's target object is freed.

**Note:** `Tween.tween_method()` is the only correct way to create `MethodTweener`. Any `MethodTweener` created manually will not function correctly.

## Methods

- **set_delay** (delay: `float`): Sets the time in seconds after which the MethodTweener will start interpolating. By default there's no delay.
- **set_ease** (ease: `EaseType`): Sets the type of used easing from `EaseType`. If not set, the default easing is used from the `Tween` that contains this Tweener.
- **set_trans** (trans: `TransitionType`): Sets the type of used transition from `TransitionType`. If not set, the default transition is used from the `Tween` that contains this Tweener.
